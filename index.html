    <!--This is our introduction into the data science pipeline-->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The main goal of this project is to guide you through the comprehensive pipeline of data science. The pipeline goes from Data Collection, Data Processing, Exploratory Analysis and Data Visualization, Model: Analysis, Hypothesis, and Machine Learning (ML), and Interpretation: Insight and Policy Decision. With this pipeline, we will be specifically focusing on the field of electric vehicles (EVs). As the concerns of the environment continue to grow and the shift towards sustainable energy gains momentum, electric vehicles have been a very popular choice for reducing carbon emissions. With this in mind, we will do a deep dive into data provided by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) which details the population of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered in the state. 
    </p>

    <p>
        So why is this important? This growth in electric vehicle adoption is not just a measure of technological advancement but it is also an indicator of shifting consumer preferences and policy effectiveness in addressing climate change. We can uncover patterns in EV adoption across different regions and time periods by analyzing the dataset. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this tutorial, we will explore various data science techniques to parse, manage, and analyze this dataset and we aim to provide actionable insights on the current state and potential future of electric vehicle usage in Washington State. By focusing on this part of sustainability, we also hope to contribute to the broader conversation on environmental policy and sustainable development.

        Here is the Data Science Lifecycle:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Data Collection</li>
        <li>Data Processing</li>
        <li>Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization</li>
        <li>Model: Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, & ML</li>
        <li>Interpretation: Insight & Policy Decision</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The first part of the data science lifecycle is data collection. In our project, we focused on gathering relevant information about the population of electric vehicles. We obtained our primary dataset, “Electruc_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv,” from the Department of Licensing (DOL) in Washington State and this dataset provides us comprehensive details on electric vehicles, including their make, model, electric range, and many other attributes.

        During this project, we will use Python as our primary language and Jupiter Notebook to develop this project. To learn more about Jupiter notebooks, click here to read about it. We will also be using the following imports.
