    <h1>The Effect of Storms in the United States</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The main purpose of this project is to take you through the entire pipeline of data science. In order to do so, we have chosen to focus on how different types of storms in the U.S. affect people and the world. As you may have heard, in June 2017 resident Donald Trump announced that the U.S will not be a part of the Paris climate agreement anymore. Major decisions such as this, once more, brought up the conversations regarding climate change and its effects on our country. While many people are debating whether climate change is real or not, we have decided to further investigate this statement by diving into Data Science and providing some facts regarding climate change. In addition to that, we will focus on how people's lives are affected. In order to make it easier to follow, we have decided to only focus on the U.S temperatures and the different types of devastating storms that happened in the U.S.</p>
    <h2>Why this is important?</h2>
    <p>Throughout time, we have seen many people's lives turn upside down after natural disasters. Storms cause many casualties and damages and it is important to try and predict how storms will affect people in the future to prepare ourselves for upcoming disasters. By looking at previous locations, we can analyze what cities are affected the most and allocate resources to those specific cities when a disaster is imminent. In addition, we need to look at average annual temperatures and try to figure out if there are any causal relationships between other variables.</p>
    <h2>Over this tutorial we will be going through the Data Science Lifecycle as following:</h2>

        <li>Data Collection</li>
        <li>Data Processing</li>
        <li>Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization</li>
        <li>Model: Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, & ML</li>
        <li>Interpretation: Insight & Policy Decision</li>
